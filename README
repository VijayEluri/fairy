Esper made easy. Not just esper, probably a lot more good stuff will go in here.

It's simple. Fairy is a command line utility that does a bunch of useful things, called Spells. 
Here's the general usage pattern :

fairy <spell> <args..>

Fairy is written in Java. So when you build it you will get a jar file and you may need to 
set up an alias for fairy="java -jar fairy.jar"
